<h2>When You Are Happy...</h2>

<p>
  When I see you being happy it also makes me happy. It's the only thing I want you to always feel. Seeing you happy brightens up my day. You being happy is all I want. Especially when I'm the reason why you're happy. It makes my heart filled with joy. The happy version of you is my favorite. Just seeing you smile eases all those negative thoughts in my head. You make me calm just by seeing your smile. I hope that you'll experience happiness everyday, free from all the troubles and worries. I only want what's best for you. Iloveyouuuuuuu so muchhh.
