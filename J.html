Please don't hesitate to share your feelings with me, especially if you feel jealous. You know that everything you feel is valid and important to me. Your emotions are important to me, just like you are. I'll do everything I can to avoid making you jealous, as I never want to see you hurt or overthink too much. You mean everything to me, and your happiness is my priority. Please, don't ever hesitate to tell me when you're feeling jealous of someone. It's important for me to understand your emotions and avoid any misunderstandings. Remember lovee, expressing your feelings doesn't worsen things it only strengthens our bond. Just like after every fight we've had, we've always learned a lesson.I'm always here to listen no matter what. Iloveyouuuuuu alwaysss my loveee.
