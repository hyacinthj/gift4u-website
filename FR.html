<h2>When You Are Frustrated...</h2>

<p>
  Whenever you are frustrated, you can always talk to me about it. You can tell me the things that bother you. You can always rant to me. It might also lessen your frustrations. And I'll do my best to always listen and to help you calm down. I'll be with you always. I'll always listen and reassure you that everything will be fine in the end. You can also call me if you want. I always have time for you. Iloveyouuuuuuu alwaysss.
