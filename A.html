<h2>When You Are Angry...</h2>

<p>
  Hii lovee. I know you're upset or angry and I want you to know I'm always here for you. You can always talk to me about the things that made you upset or angry. I won't judge. And it's okay to be upset or angry we all have our reasons. Just a reminder lovee if you're angry at someone calm your thoughts first because I don't want you to make mistakes. I mean I don't want you to do things that you might regret later. I know how our thoughts can be a mess when we are angry or upset but before making an action calm yourself first lovee. And you can always come to me first you can rant about everything. You can talk to me until your thoughts are calm. You can call me anytime lovee. I'm always here for you. I'll always look after you. We'll talk until everything's fine and when you are already calm. Iloveyouuuuuuu so muchhh.
